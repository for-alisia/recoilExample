# Recoil: State Management for React

## Key Features of Recoil

1. Flexible shared state

- Boilerplate free
- As simple as get/set

2. Derived Data

- Data can be derived safely and simply from state and other derived data
- Access derived data the same way as state
- Derived data can be synchronous or asynchronous

3. App-wide state observation

- Read any part of state
- Observe changes to state
- Persist app state
- Rehydration

## When to use Recoil?

If component tree and state structure do not match

## When not to use Recoil?

If you have close connection FE data with BE db data (Apollo or React-Query is the best approach here)

Recoil can be easily combined with some of this solution.
